A girl of 11 was sold to a child trafficker who branded her with his initial, a court heard yesterday. Mohammed Karrar, 38, also loaned her to abusers around the country for £600 an hour, it was alleged. Over five years she was repeatedly raped by large groups of men in what she described as ‘torture sex’, the jury was told. Seven men of Pakistani origin and two from North Africa are accused of 79 offences against six vulnerable white British girls. The charges include child rape, sexual trafficking and child prostitution. In the dock: Kamar Jamil, Akhtar Dogar, Anjum Dogar, Assad . Hussain, Mohammed Karrar, Bassam Karrar, Mohammed Hussain, Zeeshan Ahmed . and Bilal Ahmed are accused of abusing vulnerable girls as young as 11 . over the course of eight years in Oxford. They all deny the charges . Noel Lucas QC, prosecuting, said . Karrar – known as Egyptian Mo – bought the youngest victim from an . unnamed man just after her 11th birthday. He befriended her with gifts of perfume and hard drugs but then began to beat her up and raped her, the Old Bailey was told. He branded her with one of her hair . pins, which he had twisted into the shape of an ‘M’ and heated with a . cigarette lighter. It left a scar on her left buttock. ‘He regarded her as his property,’ Mr Lucas said. ‘He showed her no regard. If she had the temerity to resist, he beat her. ‘He branded her to make her his . property and to ensure others knew about it.’ At the age of 12 she was . introduced to Karrar’s brother Bassam, 33, who is also accused of raping . her. The girl ‘describes the Karrars as . sick sex monsters’, Mr Lucas said. ‘They were always talking about sex . and spoke about women in a vile manner. ‘Mohammed Karrar liked her to dress up and act out role play. Both brothers used to beat her.’ From the age of 12 the girl was sold . to groups of Asian men who violently raped her in private homes and . guesthouses around Oxford and elsewhere. Sometimes she was injected with . heroin or given date drugs to ensure she complied with the gang’s sick . demands, it was alleged. Mr Lucas added: ‘It became routine for . her to be taken to various locations, houses and hotels by the Karrar . brothers so she could treat their guests. She would be made to dress up, . wear very short skirts and a bikini top, do her hair and put on lots of . make-up. The jury of seven men and five women at the Old Bailey were told that the men targeted care homes and schools to find their victims . By the end of the evening she would . have been sexually used and abused by all the men. She would be so . drugged up as to be unable to feel the pain.’ Just after her 12th birthday the girl . told Karrar she was carrying his child. He allegedly beat her up and . then took her to a house in Reading where she was given a ‘backroom . abortion’ using a crochet hook. On other occasions Karrar raped the girl in the living room of her own home as her father slept in another room, it was said. Sometimes his friends would arrive at . her house and they would allegedly rape her too. The girl, who came from . a troubled family, naively believed ‘Mo’ loved her and was going to . marry her when she was 16, the court heard. During a trip to the Lake District in 2007, when she was 14, she is said to have been called by Karrar on her mobile phone. David Hughes, a social worker, answered and Karrar allegedly asked to speak to her. When Mr Hughes refused, Karrar . allegedly said: ‘If you don’t get her I’ll **** you up, I’ll **** her up . and I’ll **** her mum.’ Later the girl told the social worker of  ‘men . who took her to houses’. In January 2008, she told police a man . called ‘Egyptian Mo’ had raped her in London nine months previously. Two years later the girl contacted her alleged attacker for an apology . but was raped again, the court heard. Kamar Jamil, 27, Akhtar Dogar, 32, his . brother Anjum Dogar, 30, Assad Hussain, 32, Mohammed Karrar, Bassam . Karrar, Mohammed Hussain, 24, Zeeshan Ahmed, 27, and Bilal Ahmed, 26, . deny all the charges against them. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
