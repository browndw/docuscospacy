A firearms officer killed himself after he became 'obsessed' that his policewoman lover was seeing another policeman, an inquest heard today. PC Nick Corless, 36, was found dead in a Volkswagen Golf car parked in St Helens, Merseyside, in February last year. An inquest heard that the policeman, who worked at Manchester Airport for Greater Manchester Police, killed himself because he feared losing his job after assaulting his lover, Anne Marie Greenall, who also worked for GMP. A police officer committed suicide because he feared losing his job after assaulting his lover (file picture) PC Corless left behind his widow Lisa and son, who was one at the time of his death. According to the Whiston coroner, Dr Christopher Sumner, PC Corless had grown suspicious that his lover was seeing another police officer. This suspicion had led to several episodes of violence during the weekend of his death. Before recording a verdict of suicide, Mr Sumner said: 'At the time of his death Mr Corless seemed besotted and obsessed with the thought that she (Anne Marie) was having a relationship with another man. 'There is certainly no doubt in my mind that he was carrying out an extramarital relationship with Anne Marie Greenall. 'On the weekend of the February 25, 26 and 27 last year, there was an incident in which Nick Corless assaulted Anne Marie. 'In my mind, he thought that at best he would be referred to Greater Manchester Police's professional standards branch, and at worst he would face charges and imprisonment. 'Prison is not the best of places at any time, but it is certainly not an easy place for a police officer. 'It is clear that he intended to take his own life and therefore I can only record one verdict and that is suicide,' he added.
